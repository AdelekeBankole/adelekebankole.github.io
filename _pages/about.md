Adeleke is an applied and computational mathematician with research focusing on mathematical modeling and numerical approximation of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. His aim is the design, development, analysis and implementation of state-of-the-art discretization techniques stemming from (Finite Volume Method, Finite Difference Method, Finite Element Method, Spectral Element Method and Meshfree Methods) targeted towards numerical fluid flow simulations. Adeleke believes and understands that theory, analysis and numerics each provide contexts that help to understand the other in a deeper way. He aims to solve problems coming from computational science and engineering in an accurate, stable, fast, robust and highly performant way.

Currently, Adeleke is a research associate at the [University of Colorado Boulder USA](https://www.colorado.edu/) working under the supervision of [Prof. Jed Brown](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/jed-brown) and conducting research in collaboration with the Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project [ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/exascale-computing-project/) within the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations [CEED](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/), towards the development of a matrix-free, fast, robust, efficient, extensible and portable mathematical library [libCEED](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/libceed/) and developing, contributing and deploying new methods in and to open source scientific computing software/libraries, [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/) and [LFAToolkit.jl](https://jeremylt.github.io/LFAToolkit.jl/stable/). 

He earned his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (2017 - [University of Hamburg, Germany](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html)). Prior to joining CU Boulder, Adeleke was a research scientist and graduate student lecturer at the University of Hamburg, Germany (see link: [Uni. Hamburg](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/bankole/)) where he taught graduate classes, supervised theses and mentored graduate student projects in the joint Master's program Mathematical Modelling in Engineering: Theory, Numerics and Applications [ERASMUS Mundus Mathmods Programme](http://www.mathmods.eu/). He has an M.Sc. in Industrial Mathematics, M.Sc. Mathematical Engineering (2011 - University of Hamburg, Germany and [University of L'Aquila, Italy](https://www.univaq.it/en/)), a PGD in Mathematical Sciences (2009 - [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://aims.ac.za/) and [University of the Western Cape, South Africa](https://www.uwc.ac.za/)) and a B.Sc. in Mathematics (2007 - [University of Ilorin, Nigeria](https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/)).
